We are a Community Interest Company on the Isles of Scilly, an archipelago of 5 inhabited (and more than 100 uninhabited) islands in the Atlantic ocean, 30 miles off the coast of Cornwall, UK.

We develop and manage a range of infrastructure related to renewable energy, transport and communications to support the long term sustainability of our island community.

You can find out more about us on our [website](https://www.ioscv.co.uk).
